# Cybr: Conventional narratives about the collapse of the Kingdom of Meroe/Kush see movement of the "Noba" eastwards as a contirbuting factor.
# However, it is hard to say whether it was an invasion, migration, cultural changes in the already present population, or something in between.
# Either way, the Noba are then posited as ancestors of the later Nubians.
# Further complicating matters is there is a dearth of written materials in this period.
# However, for game purposes, I'm going with a more moderate interpretation of the migration theory
# Localized as Makha based on an older name for them (?)
