# #Setup & Misc
#
# CORE DIARCH POWERS
# diarch_revoke_title_interaction		- diarch (actor) takes a title from a vassal of their liege (recipient) with an optional veto for the liege (third_party).
# diarch_retract_vassal_interaction		- diarch (actor) takes a vassal from a vassal of their liege (recipient) with an optional veto for the liege (third_party).
# diarch_imprison_interaction			- diarch (actor) tries to move a character (recipient) within the sub-realm of their liege (third) to their dungeon, with an optional veto for the liege.
# diarch_entrench_regency_interaction	- diarch (actor) shifts the diarchy from temporary to entrenched, making it more difficult for their liege (recipient) to get rid of them.
#
# ANCILLARY DIARCH POWERS
# diarch_legal_meddling_interaction		- diarch (actor) either tests learning or spends prestige to gain an unpressed claim on a title held by a vassal of their liege (recipient).
# diarch_syphon_treasury_interaction	- diarch (actor) either tests stewardship or spends prestige to gain gold at the expense of negative modifiers delivered to the liege (recipient).
# diarch_shift_privileges_interaction	- diarch (actor) either tests diplomacy or spends prestige to give negative modifiers to the lands of a vassal of their liege (secondary recipient), who can't resist.
