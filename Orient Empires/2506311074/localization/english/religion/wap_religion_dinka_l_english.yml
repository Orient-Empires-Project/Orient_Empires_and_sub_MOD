 dinka_religion_desc:1 "The world has been created and is controlled by Nhialac, the great God of the sky and of the all important rain. It was He who created Abuk the mother goddess and tormentor Garaŋ, as well as the lesser divinities. Devotees of Nhialac make regular animal sacrifices to him for blessings, for fertility, or to heal taboos. Alongside Nhialac in the heavens are the ancestral spirits the Jak, who live all around us, as well as the Jak the free spirits who like Garaŋ can bring fortune as well as torment us."
