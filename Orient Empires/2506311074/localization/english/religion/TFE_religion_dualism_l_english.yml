 basilidianism_desc:0 "The secretive Basilidean sect has a very divergent interpretation of the Christian Gospel: the Great Archon created much of the world and thought he was God, but eventually learned to the truth, that there were higher beings than himself. Unlike other Gnostic sects, the creator repented for his sin, and sought to enlighten the world. By following Jesus, the world the Great Archon created can be purified and ascend itself."
