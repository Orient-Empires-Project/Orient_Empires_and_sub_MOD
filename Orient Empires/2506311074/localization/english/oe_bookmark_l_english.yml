 bm_867_falling: "A Sinking Junk"
 bm_867_falling_desc: "Ever since the disastrous An-Shi Rebellion and the Yuanhe Restoration (805-820AD), there has been a delicate balance between the imperial court and the Three Fanzhen of Hebei. The Fanzhen military governors need the prestige of the emperor to reassure their citizens, whereas the Tang court relies on the might of the Fanzhen to fend off the Tibetans and Nanzhao. A massive and united Tang army has gathered in the southwest, but irrespective of the outward calm, contradictions and conflicts are becoming acute. A soldier from Guilin is about to become the epicenter, igniting the fire that devours everything..."

 bookmark_falling_licui: "Emperor Li Cui"
 bookmark_falling_licui_desc: "Soon after the death of Emperor Xuanzong, Prince Li Wen became the emperor with the support of the Shence Army, thus beginning the Xiantong era (860-874). He changed his name to Li Cui and was honored by his ministers as the emperor of filial piety and virtue. Li Cui was fond of banquets, fine wine and luxurious extravagance, which gave rise to rumors that he was bringing the legacies of his forefathers to ruin. Amidst the opulent music and intoxicating wine in Chang'an, his reign appears peaceful apparently."

 bookmark_falling_wangjingchong: "Jiedushi Wang Jingchong"
 bookmark_falling_wangjingchong_desc: "The Wang family from the Uyghur Absi tribe has been inheriting for five generations under the support of their private soldiers. Wang Jingchong is the descendant of this Uyghur Wang family and the daughter of Emperor Xianzong. He maintains the peace between the imperial court and its vassals, thus becoming a symbol of ethnic integration in Hebei. Confronting the decline of Tang Dynasty and the simmering in northwestern frontiers, whichever path will he choose?"
 bookmark_falling_hequanhao: "Jiedushi He Quanhao"
 bookmark_falling_hequanhao_desc: "The Tians' regime in Weibo dominated Hebei after the An-Shi Rebellion, claiming An and Shi as apotheoses. But it is widely acknowledged that only the Sogdian private army has supremacy over Weibo. He Quanhao's grandfather, He Jintao, was held up by the private army as a new Jiedushi to ousted Shi Xiancheng. To carry on the tradition of Sogdian clans or to embrace Sinicization? Quanhao might not have much of a choice."
 bookmark_falling_gaopian: "General Protector Gao Pian"
 bookmark_falling_gaopian_desc: "As the offspring of great generals, Gao Pian has been growing to maturity among the imperial guards since childhood. He mounted successful defense against the Tibetans and Tanguts in the northwest, fought off the enemy from Nanzhao to regain possession of Annan, and reached the summit of his fame. Giao Chi is politically unstable due to ravages of war and military control. Does the mighty Jinghai Army have other alternatives besides guarding the empire's southern frontier?"

 bookmark_falling_mengshilong: "King Meng Shilong"
 bookmark_falling_mengshilong_desc: "It is said that the Nanzhao was a chiefdom founded by Yi people from Ailao. By now, the young and impetuous Meng Shilong has assumed the title of emperor and changed his country's name to Dali, trying to be on an equal footing with the Tang Dynasty. He launched an offensive against Annan and Xichuan Circuit, conquered the former twice but was driven out by Gao Pian eventually. Such a failure put him to shame. Worse still, the White and Black Mywa around Erhai Lake are on the point of stirring up trouble, the Sinicized family has become powerful ministers in court as well. What seeds is Shilong sowing - the rejuvenation or the downfall?"
 bookmark_falling_linghutao: "Jiedushi Linghu Tao"
 bookmark_falling_linghutao_desc: "Linghu Tao became imperial chancellor due to his father's legacy in the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. Given the power he has enjoyed, his achievements have been lackluster. The hard-driving emperor led to his discreet style somehow. After Yizong's accession, he has been appointed as Jiedushi for four terms and associated with poets like Li Shangyin and Wen Tingyun. The prissy man just hope to nurture his later years, but a unprecedented riot is about to break out!"

bookmark_falling_pangxun: "Quartermaster Pang Xun"
 bookmark_falling_pangxun_desc: "The hometown Xuzhou is far-off, yet your fellows have garrisoned Guilin for years which are long overdue for the duration of military service. Instead of rotating your shifts, the imperial court still want to boost campaign in the southwest. Pang Xun detected that there is a shortage of grain, and their superior officers cheat soldiers out of their pay. The nostalgic troops are getting agitated. Don't you want to hurry home to your family before falling in battle?"

 bm_867_normads: "Normads at the Gate"
 bm_867_normads_desc: "The once mighty Shuofang Army faded away, while the babarians recruited by Shuofang have already thrived. During six decades of war between Tang and Tibet, tribes of Toyghon, Shatuo, Tibetan and Tangut migrated eastwards to submit to Tang's rule. Their leaders became adjutants in the army or held the imperial insignia to fight in Tang's hinterland. In the north, the collapse of Uyghur Qaghanate produced disorder throughout the steppe. The Toquz Oghuz tribes descended into chaos so the power vacuum has not been filled. It is an epoch in which heroes are emerging."

 bookmark_normads_liguochang: "Chieftain Zhuye Chixin"
 bookmark_normads_liguochang_desc: "The Shatuo Turk tribe which led by Zhuye Chixin's ancestors have submitted to Tang Dynasty for three generations. He established illustrious military exploits for the empire, thus rewarded with the royal Li surname and Guochang (country prospered) as given name. However, the aggrandizing of his tribe has threatened the vassal state of Hedong as well as the Toyghon migrants, for which the latter will brew a mobbing. Guochang and his sons must prove that they are still loyal to Tang's sovereign, and provide living space for the tribe."
 bookmark_normads_helianduo: "Helian Duo, Warlord of Toyghon"
 bookmark_normads_helianduo_desc: "The Helian clan has grazed north of the Wuding River for hundreds of years, being called as \"patrilineally Xiongnu, matrilineally Serbi\". At present, they lead the Toyghon refugees who migrated eastwards for the empire. Facing the offensive Shatuo and Tangut tribes, their chieftain Helian Duo figures to draw the imperial court in and bide the time to regain the soil once belonged to the Great Chanyu."

 bookmark_normads_tuobasigong: "Tuoba Sigong"
 bookmark_normads_tuobasigong_desc:1 "During the violent Tibetan civil war and Lon Khrom Zhe's rebellion, the Tangut folks of Tuoba Sigong were engulfed to migrate eastwards and arrived in Shuofang and Xiazhou. He served a Tang general for a dot of habitat. The Tanguts can't be prodigal in this dilemma. They are obliged to dance around the great powers, but maybe the breeding of a great dynasty is about to start."

 bookmark_normads_Undesh: "Chieftain Yundeshi"
 bookmark_normads_Undesh_desc: "The Yaruds are just minor chiefs under Yaonian khans of Khitan, but Yundeshi has noticed and utilized the mess in the steppe. He was allied with prominent Khitan families, united the Uyghur absconded officers in marriage, and the Chinese craftmanship was introduced. His elaborate management will blossom and bear fruit in the era of his grandchildren."

 bookmark_normads_zhangyunshen: "Jiedushi Zhang Yunshen"
 bookmark_normads_zhangyunshen_desc: "The Zhang family served as field officers in Youzhou for generations. Although Zhang Yunshen was proposed as Lulong Jiedushi by the lieutenants, he guarded the northern frontier loyally for the Tang Empire. The plundering by Khitans and Qay was put to rest and the trades with Balhae are unimpeded flourishing. The title of imperial chancellor is bestowed upon Yunshen, making him Jiexiang. Can his family continues to keep the peace in the north?"

 bookmark_normads_Borjigin: "Bodonchar Munkhag Borjigin"
 bookmark_normads_Borjigin_desc: "People say that the primogenitor of golden lineage was born of the glitter by Alan Gua the great grandmother. Bodonchar Munkhag, being her most proud son, was the direct ancestor of Genghis Khan. The appellation of \"Shirwi Mongghol\" was mentioned in the late Tang Dynasty, not at the head of Onon, but in right bank of Ergune. It is from the Shirwi woods that the golden lineage set off their warpath to the world."

 bookmark_normads_shangyanxin: "河渭大都督 尚延心"
 bookmark_normads_shangyanxin_desc: "在撕碎吐蕃帝国的混战中，出身高贵的尚延心率先逃离战火，以秦渭之地归附唐朝，保境安民，谋求吐蕃居民与陇西汉人的和平共处。在他的渭水河谷，没有唐蕃之分，只有和平和战犯的较量。刚刚，他剿灭了论恐热的最后残部，将他们遣送唐军。这乱世中，和平还能延续多久？"


 bm_867_silkroad: "Silk Road Struggling"
 bm_867_silkroad_desc: "The tremendous Uighur Khanate and the Tubo Empire both collapsed. The dispersed Uighur kings and the Tiele tribes moved westward, landing on the east side of the Tianshan Mountains and the Jiuyan Sea; Zhang Zhichao, who was from Shazhou, made the west side of the river revert to the Great Tang for nineteen years; to last year, the ravaging bLon Khrom brZhe of the west side of the river has finally come to an end, and Pugujun rose in the north court, confronting with the Khan of Solimi. At the crossroads of the four great civilizations, can the Han generals, the Fans, the Wimmins, the Togolese, the Scythians, the Uighur, the Toghuns, and the Geluks live in harmony?"

 bookmark_silkroad_zhangyichao: "Jiedushi Zhang Yichao"
 bookmark_silkroad_zhangyichao_desc: "Since the overthrow of Tubo rule by troops nineteen years ago, Zhang Yichao's reputation is growing, but he has been jealous and decentralized by the court. Zhang Yichao, who is under house arrest in Chang'an, has transferred power to his son and generals, and still calls himself \"Hexi Jiedu Shi\", rather than the \"guiyi\" canonized by the court; the reason is simple, the Hexi people are the sons and daughters of the Han family who have been occupied by the Fans for many years, rather than the Fanbang who belonged to the heavenly dynasty."

 bookmark_silkroad_murongfu: "Prince of the Tuyuhun, Murong Fu"
 bookmark_silkroad_murongfu_desc: "Murong Fu was the last descendant of the glorious Tuyuhun kingdom and in the face of the advancing Tubo, had led his troops eastward to Anle Prefecture, was conferred the Grand Governor-General of Tuyuhun, and has not been heard from since; in Paradox's Vanilla world line, his life was delayed by 45 years, which gave him a chance to compete in contest, as his name suggests, restore the glory of the Tuyuhun kingdom."

 bookmark_silkroad_Bokut: "Syrtws Bokut Kur"
 bookmark_silkroad_Bokut_desc: "Although Pang Tegin had reestablished a Qaghanate in Sulmi, the Toquz Oghuz people who migrated westward remained internal conflicts. Bughu Jun, who was not born into a lineage of Uyghur Qaghans, rised as he swept away the remnants of rival Tibetans around Tien Shan. He seized the Xizhou region, made contact with Zhang Yichao and the imperial court of Tang to contend for hegemony among Toquz Oghuz. The road towards ascendancy is obstacle-packed, for he feels the pull of Tiele tribes in Yizhou whereas the Uyghur regime in Sulmi won't treat him with indulgence. O Bughu Tengri Ilig, To where shall providence take you?"

 bookmark_silkroad_ediz: "Ediz Uyghur, Juyan Lake"
 bookmark_silkroad_ediz_desc: "The Ediz was the ruling clan of the second dynasty of Uyghur Qaghanate. Twenty six years ago, their political infighting incurred the Kirghiz's decapitation. Thus, the qaghan was murdered, the tegins were scattered, and countless refugees fleed southwards. Yet the suspicion by the Tang dynasty and threats of other nomads tormented them. At last they went over to Hexi and tabernacled by the Juyan Lake. So what is next? Heading west will be caught in the crossfire of the Tiele tribes east of Tien Shan; heading south, the fertile valley of Ganzhou is at hand, furthermore, the slush from Qilian Mountains nourishes the flock. However, the powerful Han army and the agile Longjia people entrenched there."

Still, just behind him, the tribe that suffered a lot because of the push for presenting famous eagles as a tribute to Liao, the son of destiny is about to be born."
