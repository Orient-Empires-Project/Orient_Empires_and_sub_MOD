#Son of Yi according to 蔡氏族譜世系序 known also as 宋淳熙四年戡公序 which is acribed to great-grandson of 蔡襄, otherwise well attested 蔡戡. This short preface is contained in the gealogical books of some Cai families, which makes it better classified as para-historical source, rather than historical. There are no offical historical sources which confirm that. The best thing is mention by 歐陽修 on the epitagraph for Cai Xiang that he is a descendant of 蔡克 and that his family was once great, but then diminished in importance. Paradoxically an argument for the authenticity of this preface is its incompletness, between 文表 and his great-great-grandson 劍 there is a lacuna, showing that the author didn't made up everything, as otherwise he would fill them out too. Although, I remain sceptical, I'll accept this document for the purpose of the mod.
